# Useful Personal Unity Scripts
This is my personal repo of useful unity scripts. Mostly old stuff to use as reference or to archive away. Maybe you will find here something worth using?
Not all of it works, not all of it is intended to work, but you might find something useful here. I won't make any edits that I don't personally need, but feel free to ask me any questions you may have.

Every time I take a break from Unity, I forget how to script even basic things. This repo helps me remember.
