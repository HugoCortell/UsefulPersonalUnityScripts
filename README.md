# Useful Personal Unity Scripts
This is my personal repo of useful unity scripts. Maybe you will find here something worth using?

I just drop stuff I commonly use, not all of it works, not all of it is intended to work, but you might find some use to what I have. I wont make any edits that I dont personally need, but feel free to ask me any questions you may have.
